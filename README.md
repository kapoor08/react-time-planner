# React TimePlanner

**React TimePlanner** is a React.js application built to demonstrate how to handle complex **form validations** for time-based inputs in a real-world scenario. This app enables barbers (or similar professionals) to configure their **weekly working schedule** including shop hours, working periods, and break times—on a day-by-day basis.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on solving real-life scheduling problems using **React Hook Form** and **Yup**, making it ideal for developers looking to learn advanced form validation techniques in React.

Users can input:

- Shop Open/Close times
- Working Start/End times
- Break Start/End times

All input is validated with custom logic and schema validation, and the resulting schedule is displayed in the console for review.

## ✨ Features

-✅ **Daily Schedule Configuration**: Define shop, working, and break hours for each day of the week.

- ✅ **Advanced Validation with Yup**: Custom validation rules ensure time sequences are logical (e.g., working hours fall within shop hours, breaks within working hours).

- ✅ **Real-Time Data Logging**: Submitted schedule data is printed to the browser console for further use.

- ✅ **Clean & Responsive UI**: Built using **Material UI v5** and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive design.

- ✅ **Phone Number Validation**: International phone input with validation via `google-libphonenumber`.
